# Nomad Conversions

Repo of Docker Compose and/or Kubernetes manifests converted to Nomad Jobspecs.

If I'm feeling extra-adventurous, I will try creating Nomad Packs for these.

This is work in progress.

## Nomad binary

You can download the Nomad binary [here](https://developer.hashicorp.com/nomad/downloads).

## Running the examples

You can run all of these examples on [Hashiqube](https://hashiqube.com). I have a fork of Hashiqube with all of the configs required to run jobspecs in this repo, which you can check out [here](https://github.com/avillela/hashiqube/README.md).
